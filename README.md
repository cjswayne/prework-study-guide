# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was born out of a desire to prepare effectively for a coding bootcamp. The primary goal was to create a webpage that consolidates notes from prework lessons, offering an easily accessible reference tool for both study and quick consultation later in the bootcamp. It addresses the need for a streamlined and efficient way to display study content. Throughout this project, I have acquired foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning how these technologies synergize to craft a webpage.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these technical steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
3. Use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code to run the project. This extension allows you to view your webpage with live reloading.

## Usage

This webpage serves as a practical example of how basic web development concepts come together to form a functioning website. It is an effective tool for note-taking, designed to be particularly useful for students. Key features include:

- A random topic generator, which displays an output in the developer tools console to see what you should study.
- An automatic feature that collects all headers from the notes for the random topic generator, eliminating the need for manual input.
